#Requirements for the first deadline:

##Project title

I Want Pizza, but I Don't Want a Whole One

##Problem statement (i.e., what is the problem?)

People often want pizza, but don't want to order a whole pizza just for themselves.

##How do you solve the problem?

Our website will bring these hungry people together by providing contact information for nearby people who also want to eat pizza, but not a whole one.

##List of all the features that your team will implement (including which of the "Pick 3" items were chosen by the team). Your team will be held accountable for the features you list!

Geolocation
Front-end framework
Server-side data persistence

##What data will your prototype be using and collecting

Our prototype will use geolocation data and will collect information about the person who posted the pizza-requests contact information. This contact information could be an email, a phone number, or a location (i.e. Halligan 118)

##Any algorithms or special techniques that will be necessary

We will use the location of the request and the location of the user to calculate the distance between the person using the app and the person requesting a pizza.

##Electronic mockups of what your team will be developing using wireframes. No hand-drawn mockups accepted. Tools to create wireframes include Balsamiq (commercial; de facto standard), Gliffy, MockFlow, and even Microsoft PowerPoint.

## Comments by Ming
* Fun idea
* Sorry, Geolocation, front-end framework are not features.  What will geolocation be used for? Ditto with email.  A feature is *what* the user(s) will *do*
* Missing: list of pizza shops in an area
