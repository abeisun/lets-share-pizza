### Actually read this @the group!

### This contains real information about the server, and what needs to be done to finalize it.

### Routes that need to be finalized

* POST /startOrder
* POST /requestSlice

### Running the local web server

Just cd into this folder here (node-js-archetype) and run `heroku local web`

### Other misc stuff that needs to be finalized

To write the remaining routes, we need a database with proper collections

To finish the site, we need to connect this application to a heroku server

### Basic structure of this directory

Finished pages go into the `pages` directory - in the index.js file, this 
directory is set as the root for the entire directory on `index.js:23`
