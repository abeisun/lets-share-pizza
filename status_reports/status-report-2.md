## Progress made this week
### This week, we incorporated the Google Places API to fetch and display all
### locations matching the query "pizza delivery" onto the map.

## Difficulties faced this week
### Figuring out Google APIs is always a bit if a learning curve; specifically,
### the Google places API required a good bit of muddling around before any
### usable information could be retrieved.

## Upcoming goals
### Our upcoming goals can be found in the GitHub issues section, which we have
### begun utilizing to organize our work and structure our progress.
